Rutgers Data Sciences Bootcamp, Module 15 Challenge (06 June 2023)

This module challenge utilizes JavaScript to create an interactive visualization of earthquake data laid out on a map for the past 7 days. (https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson) 

Using Leaflet, a map is created to plot all the earthquakes from our dataset based on their longitude and latitude.
* The data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes will appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color.
* When clicking on a particular marker, information about the earthquake will appear (occurence, location, and magnitude).
* Legend display shows the depth of the earthquake.
